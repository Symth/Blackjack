Mike: Fix the issue with user and dealer's hands becoming too long

# ~ ~ Anyone ~ ~ #

# - Make the message better: Hit and Loss
Make the WIN(Hit) and LOSS (Hit) messages more simpified by making them say "Your chance of winning if you hit is: X" And your chance if losing if you hit is: Y" (Seperate lines for each message)

Example:
Your chance of winning is x 
Your chance of busting/losing is y 

OR

You have a x chance to win if you hit
You have a y chance of losing/busting if you hit
